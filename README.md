# ams325-hw4

In order to run task 1 of the project you should download the hw4task1.py file. In order to run the script you can either use your command line with the prompt: "python hw4task1.py". 
The file will normalize the initial matrix, and continue to update the page rank until the difference in the rank "r" and its previous iteration is less than 1e-6. This dynamic is visualized using a plot of the r-values over time, as well as a calculation at the end which finds the difference between the largest associated eigen vector and the results of the PageRank algorithm.

For the second task of the homework you should download the game_of_life.py file and run it using the command line prompt "python game_of_life.py 100", replacing 100 with whatever value of K you want to run it with. 
The script will generate the "game of life" which takes a set of constraints and glides an initial starter grid across a 20x20 map. The code will save generated images of the resulting grid every ten steps, as well as an animation of the entire evolution sequence of this grid. The final position of the grid at the end of 100 steps is also saved as a seperate image. 
In order to edit the files effectively it is recommended to open them through an editor application. These scripts specifically were written using Visual Studio Code.
